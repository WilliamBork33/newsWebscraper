### newsWebscraper ###

###

A webscraper that runs built on JavaScript using MongoDB and Mongoose for database functions.

Must have the following to run: node.js and MongoDB, and a local server running on your computer.

After installing node.js run `npm init`. When that's finished, install and save these npm packages:

1. express

2. express-handlebars

3. mongoose

4. body-parser

5. cheerio

6. request

Then start up MongoDB in console.

If it runs, have fun!
