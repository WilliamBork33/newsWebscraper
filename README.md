### The "master" branch has "index.html" file inside the "public" folder. The same path structure needed to run live in Heroku at: https://safe-everglades-49361.herokuapp.com/

### The "gh-pages" branch has an extra "index.html" file outside the "public" folder so GitHub Pages can read and display the file as the official GitHub Page of this repository at: https://williambork33.github.io/newsWebscraper/

### The "gh-pages" branch only serves frontend without live database integration. It exists only to display a GitHub Page. Clone the master branch and not the "gh-pages" branch.
